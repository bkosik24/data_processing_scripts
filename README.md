***Data Processing Scripts - Ruby****

This is an open project that will tkae care of various data processing tasks. It reads any file formats that File.open method opens.

Runs in Pry (type 'pry' in command line)

data = ProcessData.new(input_file, output_file)

data.method_name #=> will write the data to your output file
